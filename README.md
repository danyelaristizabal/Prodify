### Getting Started, Up and running

First Option: 
Download the whole project, open the Prodify.sln inside Visual Studio and run it. 

Second Option in Mac OSX: 
Download the whole project, install .NET Core 2.2 SDK 

Open the folder where you downloaded Prodify with the terminal, 
I have the Prodify allocated in Projects
in your case instead of Projects you will have to specify the Address of 
your directory where you downloaded the game. 

For example in my case this would be: 
```
cd Projects/Prodify/Prodify 
```
and then run the Program.cs with dotnet run command:
```
dotnet run Program.cs 
```
